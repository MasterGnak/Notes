        My name is Yoshikage Kira. I\'m currently 33 years old. Not that you\'d care, but I reside in northeast Morioh\'s villa district. Also, I\'ve yet to marry. In order to make a living, I work for Kame Yu department stores. After a long day\'s work, I return home no later than 8 PM. I don\'t like smoking, but do enjoy the occasional drink. I\'m always in bed by 11 PM, and I make it a point to get no less than eight hours of sleep each night. Before bed, I drink a warm glass of milk. It\'s always coupled with twenty minutes of stretching to decompress from the long work day. Sweet dreams are the usual result of this. I then awake as refreshed and recharged as a newborn child, ready to take on the day\'s challenges. And after my last checkup, I was given a clean bill of health. For as long as I can remember, I\'ve done everything in my power to live a productive life that allows me to pursue a lasting inner peace. This may be a foreign concept, but I choose not to concern myself with winning or losing, life\'s troubles, or enemies who bring sleepless nights. That is how I cope with this backwards life we find ourselves living. It\'s what brings me happiness in a world fraught with hardship and misery. Of course, if I were ever to engage in combat, I would win the battle without question.\n
